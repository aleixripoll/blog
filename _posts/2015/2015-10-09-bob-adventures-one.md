Bob is starting to get the hang of this. Sometimes he doesn’t even have to ask the questions anymore, he just flashes his magic microphone here and there and humans blow his mind with their bullshit. 

So there was this human couple and Bob couldn’t quite get the cheesiness of the event. It’s hard to cope with humanity’s view of love when you come from a planet that has rationalized feelings. Poor Bob, he has been cursed with science.

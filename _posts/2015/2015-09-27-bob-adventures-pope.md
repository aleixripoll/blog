Now Bob is in Vatican City. The Pope is giving a public speech to his followers and Bob somehow managed to switch the Popeâ€™s microphone with his  magic one. Bob is going to destroy our beloved religion with his fucked up plutonian science! Religion disappeared from Pluto 56 milion years  ago, since then plutonians have dealt with their own problems. But humans are not ready for that. Damn Bob.

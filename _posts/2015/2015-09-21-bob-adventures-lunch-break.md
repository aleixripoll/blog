Bob managed to infiltrate a major company to report on a human lunch  break. They probably hired him because he looks respectable in a hat and tie. It’s hard to read past that when you are a primitive life form from an undeveloped planet. In any case, sooner or later they’ll find out he’s not a senior Java programmer and fire him, or promote him to CTO.

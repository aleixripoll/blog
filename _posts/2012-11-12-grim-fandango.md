> Manny: How's the flow tonight?
<br/>
Lupe: We're dead tonight, Manny. Everybody's back home for the Day of the Dead, I guess... except for the casino. The casino's hopping. Why is it that all the people who don't go home are the same people who just love to gamble?
<br/>
Manny: Well, I guess when you've got nothing to go home to, you've got nothing to lose.
<br/>
Lupe: Hey, we should put that over the door!

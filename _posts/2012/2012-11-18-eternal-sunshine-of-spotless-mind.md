> Clementine: Joel, I'm not a concept. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
<br/>
Joel: I remember that speech really well.
<br/>
Clementine: I had you pegged, didn't I?
<br/>
Joel: You had the whole human race pegged.
<br/>
Clementine: Probably.
<br/>
Joel: I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
<br/>
Clementine: I know.
